I received my B.S. in Biochemistry from the University of Havana. Then I moved to Toronto, Canada and worked in the lab of Dr. Cathy Barr studying the genetic basis of psychiatric disorders. Later, I completed a Masterâ€™s in Biostatistics at the University of Toronto. Since then, I have been working as a statistical genetics analyst on different research projects at the Sickkids Hospital in Toronto and the Hussman Institute for Human Genomics at the University of Miami, using statistical and bioinformatics tools to study the genetic and epigenetic basis of diseases. Recently, I have worked with Dr. Lily Wang and Dr. Gabriel Odom on the development of a new tool, coMethDMR, for identifying co-methylated and differentially methylated regions in epigenome-wide association studies.
