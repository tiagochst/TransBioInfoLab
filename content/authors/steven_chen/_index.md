Xi (Steven) Chen, Ph.D. is Professor of Biostatistics in the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. He is also the Director of the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. Previously, he was a tenured Associate Professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Dr. Chen’s research interests focus on statistical genomics for cancer research, especially developing and applying innovative statistical and bioinformatics methodology to facilitate translational genomic research from bench to clinic. Dr. Chen is the Principle Investigator of a NCI R01 grant “Integrative prediction models for metastasis risk in colon cancer” which collects data on mRNA expression, somatic mutations, and clinical information to develop clinical-genomic risk prediction models and to identify subtypes for colon cancer patients. Dr. Chen is also a major contributor for identifying six triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes and corresponding gene signatures. He is the developer of the web-based software “TNBCtype”, which has been widely used by the breast cancer research community. He was awarded an NCI R01 grant “Integrative statistical models for TNBC biomarker discovery”  to develop new methods that identify TNBC patients most likely to benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and to discover new drug target for patients who are resistant to neoadjuvant chemotherapy using integrative genomic analysis.
