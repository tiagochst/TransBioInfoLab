abstract: Random forests (RF) is a popular tree-based ensemble machine learning tool
  that is highly data adaptive, applies to “large p, small n” problems, and is able
  to account for correlation as well as interactions among features. This makes RF
  particularly appealing for high-dimensional genomic data analysis. In this article,
  we systematically review the applications and recent progresses of RF for genomic
  data, including prediction and classification, variable selection, pathway analysis,
  genetic association and epistasis detection, and unsupervised learning.
