abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease that can
  be classified into distinct molecular subtypes by gene expression profiling. Considered
  a difficult-to-treat cancer, a fraction of TNBC patients benefit significantly from
  neoadjuvant chemotherapy and have far better overall survival. Outside of BRCA1/2
  mutation status, biomarkers do not exist to identify patients most likely to respond
  to current chemotherapy; and, to date, no FDA-approved targeted therapies are available
  for TNBC patients. Previously, we developed an approach to identify six molecular
  subtypes TNBC (TNBCtype), with each subtype displaying unique ontologies and differential
  response to standard-of-care chemotherapy. Given the complexity of the varying histological
  landscape of tumor specimens, we used histopathological quantification and laser-capture
  microdissection to determine that transcripts in the previously described immunomodulatory
  (IM) and mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) subtypes were contributed from infiltrating
  lymphocytes and tumor-associated stromal cells, respectively. Therefore, we refined
  TNBC molecular subtypes from six (TNBCtype) into four (TNBCtype-4) tumor-specific
  subtypes (BL1, BL2, M and LAR) and demonstrate differences in diagnosis age, grade,
  local and distant disease progression and histopathology. Using five publicly available,
  neoadjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer gene expression datasets, we retrospectively
  evaluated chemotherapy response of over 300 TNBC patients from pretreatment biopsies
  subtyped using either the intrinsic (PAM50) or TNBCtype approaches. Combined analysis
  of TNBC patients demonstrated that TNBC subtypes significantly differ in response
  to similar neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 41% of BL1 patients achieving a pathological
  complete response compared to 18% for BL2 and 29% for LAR with 95% confidence intervals
  (CIs; [33, 51], [9, 28], [17, 41], respectively). Collectively, we provide pre-clinical
  data that could inform clinical trials designed to test the hypothesis that improved
  outcomes can be achieved for TNBC patients, if selection and combination of existing
  chemotherapies is directed by knowledge of molecular TNBC subtypes.
