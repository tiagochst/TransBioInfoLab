abstract: DNA methylation differences in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have been reported.
  Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of more than 1000 prefrontal cortex brain samples
  to prioritize the most consistent methylation differences in multiple cohorts. Using
  a uniform analysis pipeline, we identified 3751 CpGs and 119 differentially methylated
  regions (DMRs) significantly associated with Braak stage. Our analysis identified
  differentially methylated genes such as MAMSTR, AGAP2, and AZU1. The most significant
  DMR identified is located on the MAMSTR gene, which encodes a cofactor that stimulates
  MEF2C. Notably, MEF2C cooperates with another transcription factor, PU.1, a central
  hub in the AD gene network. Our enrichment analysis highlighted the potential roles
  of the immune system and polycomb repressive complex 2 in pathological AD. These
  results may help facilitate future mechanistic and biomarker discovery studies in
  AD.
