abstract: Background and Aims Proteomics holds promise for individualizing cancer
  treatment. We analyzed to what extent the proteomic landscape of human colorectal
  cancer (CRC) is maintained in established CRC cell lines and the utility of proteomics
  for predicting therapeutic responses.  Methods Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses
  were performed on 44 CRC cell lines, compared against primary CRCs (n=95) and normal
  tissues (n=60), and integrated with genomic and drug sensitivity data.  Results
  Cell lines mirrored the proteomic aberrations of primary tumors, in particular for
  intrinsic programs. Tumor relationships of protein expression with DNA copy number
  aberrations and signatures of post-transcriptional regulation were recapitulated
  in cell lines. The five proteomic subtypes previously identified in tumors were
  represented among cell lines. Nonetheless, systematic differences between cell line
  and tumor proteomes were apparent, attributable to stroma, extrinsic signaling and
  growth conditions. Contribution of tumor stroma obscured signatures of DNA mismatch
  repair identified in cell lines with a hypermutation phenotype. Global proteomic
  data showed improved utility for predicting both known drug-target relationships
  and overall drug sensitivity as compared to genomic or transcriptomic measurements.
  Inhibition of targetable proteins associated with drug responses further identified
  corresponding synergistic or antagonistic drug combinations. Our data provide evidence
  for CRC proteomic subtype-specific drug responses.  Conclusions Proteomes of established
  CRC cell line are representative of primary tumors. Proteomic data tend to exhibit
  improved prediction of drug sensitivity as compared to genomic and transcriptomic
  profiles. Our integrative proteogenomic analysis highlights the potential of proteome
  profiling to inform personalized cancer medicine.
