 abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly diverse group of cancers, and
subtyping is necessary to better identify molecular-based therapies. In this study,
we analyzed gene expression (GE) profiles from 21 breast cancer data sets and
identified 587 TNBC cases. Cluster analysis identified 6 TNBC subtypes displaying
unique GE and ontologies, including 2 basal-like (BL1 and BL2), an immunomodulatory
(IM), a mesenchymal (M), a mesenchymal stem–like (MSL), and a luminal
androgen receptor (LAR) subtype. Further, GE analysis allowed us to identify TNBC
cell line models representative of these subtypes. Predicted
“driver” signaling pathways were pharmacologically targeted
in these cell line models as proof of concept that analysis of distinct GE signatures
can inform therapy selection. BL1 and BL2 subtypes had higher expression of cell
cycle and DNA damage response genes, and representative cell lines preferentially
responded to cisplatin. M and MSL subtypes were enriched in GE for
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and growth factor pathways and cell models
responded to NVP-BEZ235 (a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) and dasatinib (an abl/src inhibitor).
The LAR subtype includes patients with decreased relapse-free survival and was
characterized by androgen receptor (AR) signaling. LAR cell lines were uniquely
sensitive to bicalutamide (an AR antagonist). These data may be useful in biomarker
selection, drug discovery, and clinical trial design that will enable alignment of
TNBC patients to appropriate targeted therapies.},
