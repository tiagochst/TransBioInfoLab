abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly diverse group of cancers,
  and subtyping is necessary to better identify molecular-based therapies. In this
  study, we analyzed gene expression (GE) profiles from 21 breast cancer data sets
  and identified 587 TNBC cases. Cluster analysis identified 6 TNBC subtypes displaying
  unique GE and ontologies, including 2 basal-like (BL1 and BL2), an immunomodulatory
  (IM), a mesenchymal (M), a mesenchymal stem–like (MSL), and a luminal androgen receptor
  (LAR) subtype. Further, GE analysis allowed us to identify TNBC cell line models
  representative of these subtypes. Predicted “driver” signaling pathways were pharmacologically
  targeted in these cell line models as proof of concept that analysis of distinct
  GE signatures can inform therapy selection. BL1 and BL2 subtypes had higher expression
  of cell cycle and DNA damage response genes, and representative cell lines preferentially
  responded to cisplatin. M and MSL subtypes were enriched in GE for epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition, and growth factor pathways and cell models responded to NVP-BEZ235 (a
  PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) and dasatinib (an abl/src inhibitor). The LAR subtype includes
  patients with decreased relapse-free survival and was characterized by androgen
  receptor (AR) signaling. LAR cell lines were uniquely sensitive to bicalutamide
  (an AR antagonist). These data may be useful in biomarker selection, drug discovery,
  and clinical trial design that will enable alignment of TNBC patients to appropriate
  targeted therapies.
