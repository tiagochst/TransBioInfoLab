abstract: The role that changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications play
  in human malignancies is poorly understood. p300 and CBP, two distinct but highly
  homologous lysine acetyltransferases (KATs), are mutated in several cancers, suggesting
  their role as tumor suppressors. In the current study, we found that deletion of
  p300, but not CBP, markedly accelerated the leukemogenesis of Nup98-HoxD13 (NHD13)
  transgenic mice, an animal model that phenotypically copies human myelodysplastic
  syndrome (MDS). p300 deletion restored the ability of NHD13 expressing hematopoietic
  stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to self-renew in vitro, and to expand in vivo,
  with an increase in stem cell symmetric self-renewal divisions and a decrease in
  apoptosis. Furthermore, loss of p300, but not CBP, promoted cytokine signaling,
  including enhanced activation of the MAPK and JAK/STAT pathways in the HSPC compartment.
  Altogether, our data indicate that p300 plays a pivotal role in blocking the transformation
  of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a role distinct from that of CBP.
