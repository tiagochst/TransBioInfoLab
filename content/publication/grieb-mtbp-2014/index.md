abstract: 'Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a clinically aggressive subtype
  of breast cancer commonly resistant to therapeutics that have been successful in
  increasing survival in ER+ and HER2+ breast cancer patients. As such, identifying
  factors that contribute to poor patient outcomes and mediate the growth and survival
  of TNBC cells remain important areas of investigation. MTBP (MDM2 Binding Protein),
  a gene linked to cellular proliferation and a transcriptional target of the MYC
  oncogene, is over-expressed in human malignancies, yet its contribution to cancer
  remains unresolved. Evaluation of mRNA expression and copy number variation data
  from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed MTBP is commonly over-expressed in
  breast cancer and 19% show amplification of MTBP. Increased transcript or gene amplification
  of MTBP significantly correlated with reduced breast cancer patient survival. Further
  analysis revealed that while MTBP mRNA is over-expressed in both ER+ and HER2+ breast
  cancers, its expression is highest in TNBC. MTBP mRNA and protein levels were also
  significantly elevated in a panel of human TNBC cell lines. Knockdown of MTBP in
  TNBC model systems induced apoptosis and significantly reduced TNBC cell growth
  and soft agar colony formation, which was rescued by expression of shRNA-resistant
  Mtbp. Notably, inducible knockdown of MTBP expression significantly impaired TNBC
  tumor growth, in vivo, including in established tumors. Thus, these data emphasize
  MTBP is important for the growth and survival of TNBC and warrants further investigation
  as a potential novel therapeutic target. Implications: MTBP significantly contributes
  to breast cancer survival and is a potential novel therapeutic target in TNBC.'
