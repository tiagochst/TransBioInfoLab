abstract: The ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), crizotinib, shows significant activity
  in patients whose lung cancers harbor ALK fusions but its efficacy is limited by
  variable primary responses and acquired resistance. In work arising from the intriguing
  clinical observation of a patient with ALK fusion+ lung cancer who had an ‘exceptional
  response’ to an IGF-1R antibody, we define a therapeutic synergism between ALK and
  IGF-1R inhibitors. Similar to IGF-1R, ALK fusion proteins bind to the adaptor, IRS-1,
  and IRS-1 knockdown enhances the anti-tumor effects of ALK inhibitors. In models
  of ALK TKI resistance, the IGF-1R pathway is activated, and combined ALK/IGF-1R
  inhibition improves therapeutic efficacy. Consistent with this finding, IGF-1R/IRS-1
  levels are increased in biopsy samples from patients progressing on crizotinib therapy.
  Collectively, these data support a role for the IGF-1R/IRS-1 pathway in both ALK
  TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant states and provide biological rationale for further
  clinical development of dual ALK/IGF-1R inhibitors.
