abstract: Cancer driver gene alterations influence cancer development, occurring in
  oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and dual role genes. Discovering dual role cancer
  genes is difficult because of their elusive context-dependent behavior. We define
  oncogenic mediators as genes controlling biological processes. With them, we classify
  cancer driver genes, unveiling their roles in cancer mechanisms. To this end, we
  present Moonlight, a tool that incorporates multiple -omics data to identify critical
  cancer driver genes. With Moonlight, we analyze 8000+ tumor samples from 18 cancer
  types, discovering 3310 oncogenic mediators, 151 having dual roles. By incorporating
  additional data (amplification, mutation, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility),
  we reveal 1000+ cancer driver genes, corroborating known molecular mechanisms. Additionally,
  we confirm critical cancer driver genes by analysing cell-line datasets. We discover
  inactivation of tumor suppressors in intron regions and that tissue type and subtype
  indicate dual role status. These findings help explain tumor heterogeneity and could
  guide therapeutic decisions.
