abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that gene set analysis, which tests disease
  association with genetic variants in a group of functionally related genes, is a
  promising approach for analyzing and interpreting genome-wide association studies
  (GWAS) data. These approaches aim to increase power by combining association signals
  from multiple genes in the same gene set. In addition, gene set analysis can also
  shed more light on the biological processes underlying complex diseases. However,
  current approaches for gene set analysis are still in an early stage of development
  in that analysis results are often prone to sources of bias, including gene set
  size and gene length, linkage disequilibrium patterns and the presence of overlapping
  genes. In this paper, we provide an in-depth review of the gene set analysis procedures,
  along with parameter choices and the particular methodology challenges at each stage.
  In addition to providing a survey of recently developed tools, we also classify
  the analysis methods into larger categories and discuss their strengths and limitations.
  In the last section, we outline several important areas for improving the analytical
  strategies in gene set analysis.
