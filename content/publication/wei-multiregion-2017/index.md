abstract: Background Distant metastasis accounts for 90% of deaths from colorectal
  cancer (CRC). Genomic heterogeneity has been reported in various solid malignancies,
  but remains largely under-explored in metastatic CRC tumors, especially in primary
  to metastatic tumor evolution.  Patients and methods We conducted high-depth whole-exome
  sequencing in multiple regions of matched primary and metastatic CRC tumors. Using
  a total of 28 tumor, normal, and lymph node tissues, we analyzed inter- and intra-individual
  heterogeneity, inferred the tumor subclonal architectures, and depicted the subclonal
  evolutionary routes from primary to metastatic tumors.  Results CRC has significant
  inter-individual but relatively limited intra-individual heterogeneity. Genomic
  landscapes were more similar within primary, metastatic, or lymph node tumors than
  across these types. Metastatic tumors exhibited less intratumor heterogeneity than
  primary tumors, indicating that single-region sequencing may be adequate to identify
  important metastasis mutations to guide treatment. Remarkably, all metastatic tumors
  inherited multiple genetically distinct subclones from primary tumors, supporting
  a possible polyclonal seeding mechanism for metastasis. Analysis of one patient
  with the trio samples of primary, metastatic, and lymph node tumors supported a
  mechanism of synchronous parallel dissemination from the primary to metastatic tumors
  that was not mediated through lymph nodes.  Conclusions In CRC, metastatic tumors
  have different but less heterogeneous genomic landscapes than primary tumors. It
  is possible that CRC metastasis is, at least partly, mediated through a polyclonal
  seeding mechanism. These findings demonstrated the rationale and feasibility for
  identifying and targeting primary tumor-derived metastasis-potent subclones for
  the prediction, prevention, and treatment of CRC metastasis.
