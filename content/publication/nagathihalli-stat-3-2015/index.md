abstract: BACKGROUND & AIMS A hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
  is the presence of a dense desmoplastic reaction (stroma) that impedes drug delivery
  to the tumor. Attempts to deplete the tumor stroma have resulted in formation of
  more aggressive tumors. We have identified STAT3 as a biomarker of resistance to
  cytotoxic and molecularly targeted therapy in PDAC. The purpose of this study is
  to investigate the effects of targeting STAT3 on the PDAC stroma and on therapeutic
  resistance.  METHODS Activated STAT3 protein expression was determined in human
  pancreatic tissues and tumor cell lines. In vivo effects of AZD1480, a JAK/STAT3
  inhibitor, gemcitabine or the combination were determined in Ptf1acre/+;LSL-KrasG12D/+;Tgfbr2flox/flox
  (PKT) mice and in orthotopic tumor xenografts. Drug delivery was analyzed by MALDI-imaging
  mass spectrometry. Collagen second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging quantified
  tumor collagen alignment and density.  RESULTS STAT3 activation correlates with
  decreased survival and advanced tumor stage in patients with PDAC. STAT3 inhibition
  combined with gemcitabine significantly inhibits tumor growth in both an orthotopic
  and the PKT mouse model of PDAC. This combined therapy attenuates in vivo expression
  of SPARC, increases microvessel density and enhances drug delivery to the tumor
  without depletion of stromal collagen or hyaluronan. Instead, the PDAC tumors demonstrate
  vascular normalization, remodeling of the tumor stroma and downregulation of cytidine
  deaminase (Cda).  CONCLUSIONS Targeted inhibition of STAT3 combined with gemcitabine
  enhances in vivo drug delivery and therapeutic response in PDAC. These effects occur
  through tumor stromal remodeling and downregulation of Cda without depletion of
  tumor stromal content.
