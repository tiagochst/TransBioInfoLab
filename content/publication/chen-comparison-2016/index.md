abstract: The prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) stage II and III patients remains
  a challenge due to the difficulties of finding robust biomarkers suitable for testing
  clinical samples. The majority of published gene signatures of CRC have been generated
  on fresh frozen colorectal tissues. Because collection of frozen tissue is not practical
  for routine surgical pathology practice, a clinical test that improves prognostic
  capabilities beyond standard pathological staging of colon cancer will need to be
  designed for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. The NanoString nCounter®
  platform is a gene expression analysis tool developed for use with FFPE-derived
  samples. We designed a custom nCounter® codeset based on elements from multiple
  published fresh frozen tissue microarray-based prognostic gene signatures for colon
  cancer, and we used this platform to systematically compare gene expression data
  from FFPE with matched microarray array data from frozen tissues. Our results show
  moderate correlation of gene expression between two platforms and discovery of a
  small subset of genes as candidate biomarkers for colon cancer prognosis that are
  detectable and quantifiable in FFPE tissue sections.
