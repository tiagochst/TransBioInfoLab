abstract: Asxl1 loss–induced myeloid malignancies are mediated partially through impaired
  ASXL1 cohesin interaction and cohesin functions., ASXL1 is frequently mutated in
  a spectrum of myeloid malignancies with poor prognosis. Loss of Asxl1 leads to myelodysplastic
  syndrome–like disease in mice; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain
  unclear. We report that ASXL1 interacts with the cohesin complex, which has been
  shown to guide sister chromatid segregation and regulate gene expression. Loss of
  Asxl1 impairs the cohesin function, as reflected by an impaired telophase chromatid
  disjunction in hematopoietic cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA
  sequencing data revealed that ASXL1, RAD21, and SMC1A share 93% of genomic binding
  sites at promoter regions in Lin−cKit+ (LK) cells. We have shown that loss of Asxl1
  reduces the genome binding of RAD21 and SMC1A and alters the expression of ASXL1/cohesin
  target genes in LK cells. Our study underscores the ASXL1-cohesin interaction as
  a novel means to maintain normal sister chromatid separation and regulate gene expression
  in hematopoietic cells.
