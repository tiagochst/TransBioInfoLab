abstract: Introduction Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous collection
  of biologically diverse cancers, which contributes to variable clinical outcomes.
  Previously, we identified a TNBC subtype that has a luminal phenotype and expresses
  the androgen receptor (AR+). TNBC cells derived from these luminal AR + tumors have
  high frequency phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit
  alpha (PIK3CA) mutations. The purpose of this study was to determine if targeting
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) alone or in combination with an AR antagonist is
  effective in AR + TNBC.  Methods We determined the frequency of activating PIK3CA
  mutations in AR + and AR- TNBC clinical cases. Using AR + TNBC cell line and xenograft
  models we evaluated the effectiveness of PI3K inhibitors, used alone or in combination
  with an AR antagonist, on tumor cell growth and viability.  Results PIK3CA kinase
  mutations were highly clonal, more frequent in AR + vs. AR- TNBC (40% vs. 4%), and
  often associated with concurrent amplification of the PIK3CA locus. PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
  had an additive growth inhibitory effect when combined with genetic or pharmacological
  AR targeting in AR + TNBC cells. We also analyzed the combination of bicalutamide
  +/- the pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 or the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor GDC-0980 in
  xenograft tumor studies and observed additive effects.  Conclusions While approximately
  one third of TNBC patients respond to neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy, recent
  studies have shown that patients with AR + TNBC are far less likely to benefit from
  the current standard of care chemotherapy regimens and novel targeted approaches
  need to be investigated. In this study, we show that activating PIK3CA mutations
  are enriched in AR + TNBC; and, we show that the growth and viability of AR + TNBC
  cell line models is significantly reduced after treatment with PI3K inhibitors used
  in combination with an AR antagonist. These results provide rationale for pre-selection
  of TNBC patients with a biomarker (AR expression) to investigate the use of AR antagonists
  in combination with PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.  Electronic supplementary material The
