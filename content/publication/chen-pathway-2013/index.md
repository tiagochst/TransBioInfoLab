abstract: 'Motivation: Pathway or gene set analysis has been widely applied to genomic
  data. Many current pathway testing methods use univariate test statistics calculated
  from individual genomic markers, which ignores the correlations and interactions
  between candidate markers. Random forests-based pathway analysis is a promising
  approach for incorporating complex correlation and interaction patterns, but one
  limitation of previous approaches is that pathways have been considered separately,
  thus pathway cross-talk information was not considered., Results: In this article,
  we develop a new pathway hunting algorithm for survival outcomes using random survival
  forests, which prioritize important pathways by accounting for gene correlation
  and genomic interactions. We show that the proposed method performs favourably compared
  with five popular pathway testing methods using both synthetic and real data. We
  find that the proposed methodology provides an efficient and powerful pathway modelling
  framework for high-dimensional genomic data., Availability: The R code for the analysis
  used in this article is available upon request., Contact: xi.steven.chen@gmail.com,
  Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.'
