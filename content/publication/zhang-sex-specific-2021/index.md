abstract: Sex is an important factor that contributes to the clinical and biological
  heterogeneities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the regulatory mechanisms underlying
  sex disparity in AD are still not well understood. DNA methylation is an important
  epigenetic modification that regulates gene transcription and is known to be involved
  in AD. We performed the first large-scale sex-specific meta-analysis of DNA methylation
  differences in AD neuropathology, by re-analyzing four recent epigenome-wide association
  studies totaling more than 1000 postmortem prefrontal cortex brain samples using
  a uniform analytical pipeline. For each cohort, we employed two complementary analytical
  strategies, a sex-stratified analysis that examined methylation-Braak stage associations
  in male and female samples separately, and a sex-by-Braak stage interaction analysis
  that compared the magnitude of these associations between different sexes. Our analysis
  uncovered 14 novel CpGs, mapped to genes such as TMEM39A and TNXB that are associated
  with the AD Braak stage in a sex-specific manner. TMEM39A is known to be involved
  in inflammation, dysregulated type I interferon responses, and other immune processes.
  TNXB encodes tenascin proteins, which are extracellular matrix glycoproteins demonstrated
  to modulate synaptic plasticity in the brain. Moreover, for many previously implicated
  genes in AD neuropathology, such as MBP and AZU1, our analysis provided the new
  insights that they were predominately driven by effects in only one sex. These sex-specific
  DNA methylation differences were enriched in divergent biological processes such
  as integrin activation in females and complement activation in males. Our study
  implicated multiple new loci and biological processes that affected AD neuropathology
  in a sex-specific manner.
