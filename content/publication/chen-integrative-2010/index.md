abstract: Prediction models that use gene expression levels are now being proposed
  for personalized treatment of cancer, but building accurate models that are easy
  to interpret remains a challenge. In this paper, we describe an integrative clinical-genomic
  approach that combines both genomic pathway and clinical information. First, we
  summarize information from genes in each pathway using Supervised Principal Components
  (SPCA) to obtain pathway-based genomic predictors. Next, we build a prediction model
  based on clinical variables and pathway-based genomic predictors using Random Survival
  Forests (RSF). Our rationale for this two-stage procedure is that the underlying
  disease process may be influenced by environmental exposure (measured by clinical
  variables) and perturbations in different pathways (measured by pathway-based genomic
  variables), as well as their interactions. Using two cancer microarray datasets,
  we show that the pathway-based clinical-genomic model outperforms gene-based clinical-genomic
  models, with improved prediction accuracy and interpretability.
