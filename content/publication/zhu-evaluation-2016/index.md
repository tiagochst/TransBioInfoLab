abstract: Defining molecular features that can predict the recurrence of colorectal
  cancer (CRC) for stage II-III patients remains challenging in cancer research. Most
  available clinical samples are Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE). NanoString
  nCounter® and Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 (HTA) are the two
  platforms marketed for high-throughput gene expression profiling for FFPE samples.
  In this study, to evaluate the gene expression of frozen tissue-derived prognostic
  signatures in FFPE CRC samples, we evaluated the expression of 516 genes from published
  frozen tissue-derived prognostic signatures in 42 FFPE CRC samples measured by both
  platforms. Based on HTA platform-derived data, we identified both gene (99 individual
  genes, FDR textless 0.05) and gene set (four of the six reported multi-gene signatures
  with sufficient information for evaluation, P textless 0.05) expression differences
  associated with survival outcomes. Using nCounter platform-derived data, one of
  the six multi-gene signatures (P textless 0.05) but no individual gene was associated
  with survival outcomes. Our study indicated that sufficiently high quality RNA could
  be obtained from FFPE tumor tissues to detect frozen tissue-derived prognostic gene
  expression signatures for CRC patients.
