abstract: Methods for gene set analysis test for coordinated changes of a group of
  genes involved in the same biological process or molecular pathway. Higher statistical
  power is gained for gene set analysis by combining weak signals from a number of
  individual genes in each group. Although many gene set analysis methods have been
  proposed for microarray experiments with two groups, few can be applied to time
  course experiments. We propose a unified statistical model for analyzing time course
  experiments at the gene set level using random coefficient models, which fall into
  the more general class of mixed effects models. These models include a systematic
  component that models the mean trajectory for the group of genes, and a random component
  (the random coefficients) that models how each gene's trajectory varies about the
  mean trajectory., We show that the proposed model (1) outperforms currently available
  methods at discriminating gene sets differentially changed over time from null gene
  sets; (2) provides more stable results that are less affected by sampling variations;
  (3) models dependency among genes adequately and preserves type I error rate; and
  (4) allows for gene ranking based on predicted values of the random effects. We
  describe simulation studies using gene expression data with “real life” correlations
  and we demonstrate the proposed random coefficient model using a mouse colon development
  time course dataset. The agreement between results of the proposed random coefficient
  model and the previous reports for this proof-of-concept trial further validates
  this methodology, which provides a unified statistical model for systems analysis
  of microarray experiments with complex experimental designs when re-sampling based
  methods are difficult to apply.
