abstract: Purpose Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with residual disease
  after neoadjuvant chemotherapy generally have worse outcome; however, some patients
  with residual tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy do not relapse. We hypothesize
  that there are subgroups of chemoresistant TNBC patients with different prognosis.  Experimental
  Design Forty-nine chemoresistant cases from 111 TNBC patients treated with neoadjuvant
  chemotherapy (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center) constituted the discovery cohort, 25
  chemoresistant samples from 47 neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated TNBC (The Methodist
  Hospital) chosen for validation. Extended validation was performed in 269 operable
  TNBC predicted to be chemoresistant by expression pattern from published data sets.  Results
  We established a 7-gene prognostic signature using dChip and gene set enrichment
  analyses. In the independent validation cohort, the classifier predicted correctly
  with positive predictive value of 75.0% and negative predictive value (i.e., relapse-free
  survival [RFS]) of 76.9% at 3 years. Those predicted to relapse had a hazard ratio
  (HR) of 4.67 (95%CI, 1.27–17.15) for relapse in 3 years. In extended validation,
  patients predicted not to relapse exhibited 3-year RFS of 78.9%, while the 3-year
  RFS was 48.5% for patients predicted to relapse, with HR of 2.61 (95%CI, 1.52–4.49).
  The TNBC subgroup predicted to have relatively favorable prognosis was characterized
  by high expression of “luminal-like” genes (androgen-receptor [AR] and GATA3); while
  the subgroup with worse prognosis was characterized by expression of cancer stem-cell
  markers.  Conclusion We developed a clinically relevant signature for patients with
  chemoresistant TNBC. For these women, new therapeutic strategies like targeting
  AR-activation or cancer stem-cells may need to be developed.
