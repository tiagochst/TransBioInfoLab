 abstract = {Purpose
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy generally have worse outcome; however, some patients with residual tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy do not relapse. We hypothesize that there are subgroups of chemoresistant TNBC patients with different prognosis.

Experimental Design
Forty-nine chemoresistant cases from 111 TNBC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center) constituted the discovery cohort, 25 chemoresistant samples from 47 neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated TNBC (The Methodist Hospital) chosen for validation. Extended validation was performed in 269 operable TNBC predicted to be chemoresistant by expression pattern from published data sets.

Results
We established a 7-gene prognostic signature using dChip and gene set enrichment analyses. In the independent validation cohort, the classifier predicted correctly with positive predictive value of 75.0% and negative predictive value (i.e., relapse-free survival [RFS]) of 76.9% at 3 years. Those predicted to relapse had a hazard ratio (HR) of 4.67 (95%CI, 1.27–17.15) for relapse in 3 years. In extended validation, patients predicted not to relapse exhibited 3-year RFS of 78.9%, while the 3-year RFS was 48.5% for patients predicted to relapse, with HR of 2.61 (95%CI, 1.52–4.49). The TNBC subgroup predicted to have relatively favorable prognosis was characterized by high expression of “luminal-like” genes (androgen-receptor [AR] and GATA3); while the subgroup with worse prognosis was characterized by expression of cancer stem-cell markers.

Conclusion
We developed a clinically relevant signature for patients with chemoresistant TNBC. For these women, new therapeutic strategies like targeting AR-activation or cancer stem-cells may need to be developed.},
