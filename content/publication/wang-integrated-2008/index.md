abstract: Gene class, ontology, or pathway testing analysis has become increasingly
  popular in microarray data analysis. Such approaches allow the integration of gene
  annotation databases, such as Gene Ontology and KEGG Pathway, to formally test for
  subtle but coordinated changes at a system level. Higher power in gene class testing
  is gained by combining weak signals from a number of individual genes in each pathway.
  We propose an alternative approach for gene-class testing based on mixed models,
  a class of statistical models that:, In microarray data analysis, when statistical
  testing is applied to each gene individually, one is often left with too many significant
  genes that are difficult to interpret or too few genes after a multiple comparison
  adjustment. Gene-class, or pathway-level testing, integrates gene annotation data
  such as Gene Ontology and tests for coordinated changes at the system level. These
  approaches can both increase power for detecting differential expression and allow
  for better understanding of the underlying biological processes associated with
  variations in outcome. We propose an alternative pathway analysis method based on
  mixed models, and show this method provides useful inferences beyond those available
  in currently popular methods, with improved power and the ability to handle complex
  experimental designs.
